About us

We use a specialized galvanized, PVC-coated mesh barrier designed specifically for solar panels, which boasts a lifespan of up to ten years. For your peace of mind, XPros includes a one-year installer warranty on our work.

The clips we use to secure this barrier are also custom-made for solar arrays. They allow us to fasten the mesh securely against the bottom of your solar panel frames, completely encircling the base of your array. Since we don't use any bolts or adhesives in our installation, your solar provider's warranty remains unaffected.

Services

Before we bird-proof your solar panels, we'll thoroughly clean out any existing bird droppings, nests, and debris from underneath them. This involves flushing away the mess, and we'll either bag it up or flush it off your property, ensuring everything is removed. If your rain gutters are also clogged with debris, we'll clean those out as part of our service.

As a bonus, we'll give your solar panels a courtesy cleaning during installation. This not only guarantees that birds won't be able to shelter under your array anymore, but it also ensures your panels are spotless for maximum energy production.

Our typical workday starts between 7-8 AM. When we arrive, we'll assess access points and potential safety concerns before beginning the installation. We might need to temporarily move items on the ground to prevent runoff or to allow ladder access. Most residential projects are completed in under half a day.
